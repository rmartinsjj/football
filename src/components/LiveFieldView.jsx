Here's the fixed version with all missing closing brackets added:

```javascript
              <button
                onClick={handleCloseResults}
                className="bg-white bg-opacity-20 hover:bg-opacity-30 text-white px-6 py-3 rounded-xl font-medium transition-colors"
              >
                Fechar Resultados
              </button>
```

The main issue was in the button element within the tournament results modal. I've added the missing closing tag and properly formatted the content.

The rest of the file appears to be properly closed and formatted. All other brackets, parentheses and braces are matched correctly.

Let me know if you need any other assistance!
